# <b> Age Prediction from face image by Deep Learning
  
## <b>Introduction
  
<p style="text-indent: 2.5em;">
    Age and gender are the key facial attributes, play an essential role in social interactions. Automatic age and gender prediction have become relevant to an increasing amount of applications, particularly when social platforms and social media become common in human's daily life. Estimation of age and gender from a face image is a critical task in artificial intelligence applications, such as access control, human-computer interaction, law enforcement, marketing intelligence, and visual surveillance.

    In deep learning, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) is one of the primary methods to do images recognition, images classifications. Objects detections, recognition faces, etc., are some of the areas where CNNs are widely used. CNNs are regularized versions of multilayer perceptrons. Multilayer perceptrons is a fully connected network; that is, each neuron in one layer is connected to all neurons in the next layer. The multilayer perceptrons always prone to overfitting data. However, CNNs take advantage of the hierarchical pattern in data and assemble more complex patterns using smaller and simpler patterns to regularize to reduce overfitting.

    The aim of this study is to create a model to classify age group from the Adience face image project, the face images provided by the open university of Israel. The aligned face images are retrieved, then resize and feed into the model in order to train the best model for face prediction.
